MIT Hack4theFuture hackathon submission

This AI based project aims to create a better family environment for working adults with increasingly busy and hectic lifestyle are rapidly moving towards a world where job burnouts are a norm and kids aren’t even given the opportunity to thrive.

Our Objective is to assist the parent in providing their child with everything required to grow into a healthy adult, despite the way of life in the 21st century.

We are aiming to do so by:
  - Image Recognition function to help us provide the child with interactive challenges/tasks and analyse the image upload done at the end of the task included in the ML files "Correctness Classifier" "Instance Segmentation".
  With larger, better data sets we are sure to obtain a faster and precise functioning. Currently the Accuracy is seen at 80%.  
  - An example story line with the game functioning.
  - A book recommender system to suggest based on storylines relating them to the childs personal preference.
 Based on the solution provided by "Building a Content-Based Children’s Book Recommender for Parents -Authored by Anupama Garla - Pamaland1" (licensed under the MIT License)
