MIT Hack4theFuture hackathon submission

This AI based project aims to create a better family environent as working adults with increasingly busy and hectic lifestyle are rapidly moving towards a world where job burnouts are a norm and kids aren’t even given the opportunity to thrive.

Our Objective is to assist the parent in providing their child with everything required to grow into a healthy adult, despite the hectic way of life in this 21st century.

We are aiming to do so by:
  - Image Recognition function to help us provide the child with interactive challenges/tasks: included in the ML files "Correctness Classifier" "Instance Segmentation".
  With larger, better data sets we will be able to achieve a faster and precise functioning. Currently we are able to obtain 80% accuracy.  
  - An example story line with the game functioning is also included.
  - A book recommender system to suggest based on storylines relating them to the childs personal preference.
 Based on the solution provided by "Building a Content-Based Children’s Book Recommender for Parents -Authored by Anupama Garla - Pamaland1" (licensed under the MIT License)
